# YOLO v1 with R language ( MxNetï¼šA flexible and efficient library for deep learning. )

(Version 0.1, Last updated :2018.07.02)

### 1.Introduction

This is tensorflow implementation of the YOLO:Real-Time Object Detection

It can only do predictions using pretrained YOLO_small & YOLO_tiny network for now.

(+ YOLO_face detector from https://github.com/quanhua92/darknet )

I extracted weight values from darknet's (.weight) files.

My code does not support training. Use darknet for training.

Original code(C implementation) & paper : http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
