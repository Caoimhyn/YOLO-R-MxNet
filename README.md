(Version 0.1, Last updated :2018.07.02)

#### MxNetï¼šA flexible and efficient library for deep learning.



### 1.Introduction

This is mxnet implementation of the YOLO:Real-Time Object Detection.
YOLO is an unified framework for object detection with a single network. 

It has been originally introduced in this research [article](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/yolo.pdf).

This repository contains a MxNet implementation of a MobileNets_V2-based YOLO networks.
